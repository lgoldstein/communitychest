A few observations about the JWS protocol

- java.io.IOException: File too large can occur for files >= 1MB. Note that
this is an empirical (!) number and may change per platform/JVM/OS/etc..
However, it seems that keeping the files ~0.5MB always works.

offline-allowed element - Indicates if the application can be launched off-line
(that is, without a connection to the originating server). Unless you specify
it, the application can only be launched online (that is, with a
connection back to the originating server).

- extension elements must also be JAR(s) otherwise a launch error occurs (complains
that "missing jnlp element...")

- using unsigned JAR(s) even if network/file/printer access required can be
achieved via command line invocation of the JAVAWS:

	javaws -J-Djava.security.policy="<POLICY-FILE-LOCATION>" "<JNLP-URL>"
	
	Where:
		POLICY-FILE-LOCATION - location of a file containing the security
			policy - e.g., to allow ALL permissions simply use a file with
			the following contents:
			
			grant {
      			// Allow for everything now
      			permission java.security.AllPermission;
			};


	JNLP-URL - the URL for retrieving the JNLP file - e.g., "http://somehost:someport/file.jnlp"
	
		Note: if you omit the "file.jnlp", the default is usually "launch.jnlp"
